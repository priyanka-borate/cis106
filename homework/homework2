2. What are the basic freedoms that make a software open source?
- Have the ability of modifying source code, working with people 
3. Why do you think people should use the free software/open-source alternative instead of the proprietary version
- People should use the open source alternative so users can have more flexibility and providing endless possibilities. Meanwhile proprietary version would limit a persons creativity since the software are owned by companies/people. Not providing people to make changes, shared or built on. 

- 4. Do you agree with Richard Stallman? Do you disagree? Explain your answer. 
 I agree with him, non open source softwares should not exist, due to the fact that users should be able to run, download or make changes how they want. The user should have all the power needed. If users want to distribute copies of their program to the public they can. Since programmers developed the code it is going to be secure for them and any users.

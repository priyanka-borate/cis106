- Kali Linux would be a good alternative for John because on of the ways you can run Kali Linux is from a USB live. Making Kali bootable from USB drive is a very easy process, making it a permanent download. The amount of RAM Kali needs is 128GB, John has more than enough. Kali Linux has great speed giving John and advantage on rebooting quicker. 



Mario is concerned about his children using the house computer. He has an older laptop that he has not used in a while and has hired you to prepare that laptop for his children to use. Mario wants the children to use the computer mostly for educational purposes so he asks you to install educational tools in it. He is also concerned about his children using the internet so asks you if you could somehow install a web browser/search engine that has parental control or at least blocks adult content. Mario has given you $150 dollars for upgrades so that if needed you can proceed without contacting him. Which Linux distribution would install in Mario’s older laptop?

    - Timekpr-nExT would be a great option for Mario since it runs smoothly on linux, and it has everything Mario wanted. Limiting  child activity on a computer while monitoring it, Mario can set predefining rules. He can also limit the amount of screening everyday or monthly, giving Mario different types of controlling settings. On of the good things about Timekpr-nExT is that is an updated and better version of Timekpr-Revived which was used in 2012. To install Timekpr-nExT is a easy process too just have to download it from the terminal.

- Lakka OS  would be great Linux Distribution for Johanna to try, it was transform her computer into a game console. Since Johanna is a gamer and has experience with computers it would be an easy process for her to switch. It is not recommend for first-time linux users to use this distribution. It is a powerful distribution making it easier for Johnna to keep up to her live streams and gaming sessions. 



Giorgina has an old computer that came with Windows Vista. She cannot afford to buy a new computer or update her current PC. Her computer is used for online shopping, reading emails, paying her bills, and listening to music. All her music is on an external hard drive and she normally does not keep important information on her computer. Georgina is willing to pay you to make her computer faster. You have concluded that installing Linux is the simplest and most cost-efficient way to help her. However, in such an old PC, Ubuntu 20.04 will be almost as slow as Windows 10 so you need to find another distribution that is much lighter on system resources and has been designed for running on older hardware. Which distribution will you install in Georgina’s dinosaur PC?

Xubuntu would be a great option for Giorgina since it was especially made for users with older software. It is also built around lightweight software with a lot of consideration for usability. It is already installed with helpful applications such as web browser, a mail client and applications to handle your media like music. Since Giorgina has her music on an external hard drive she can easily transfer her music. Xubuntu will also make her computer faster compared to what it was. One of the best parts about using this distribution is that it is free.
